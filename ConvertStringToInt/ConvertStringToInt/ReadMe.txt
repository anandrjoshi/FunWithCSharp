Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. 
Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as 
possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
