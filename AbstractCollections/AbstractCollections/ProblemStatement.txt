Create a base class named Flower.
Create several child classes like Rose, Lily, etc.
Each can have its own collection of petals. This collection can be a list or array or any other collection.
Build a system that takes in a FLower and can iterate through petals of each flower without changing the iteration based on the collection of 
petals implemented.

Implement a Zoo class that has collection of Mammals, Birds, Insects, reptiles.
Mammals class implements collection as List of strings
Birds class implements collection as array of strings
Insects class implements collection as ArrayList of strings
Reptiles class implements collection as Dictionary of int and string.
Zoo class should be able to iterate through all the animals collection agnostic.
